      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-my-week-went&#34;&gt;How my week went&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was a mix of everything: a bit of studying, a bit of procrastination, and lots of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to be productive, but every time I opened my laptop, I somehow ended up on YouTube or playing a new game.
Still, I managed to get a few things done, so my conscience is (mostly) clear.
Trying to convince myself that rest is also a part of being productive.ðŸ˜ª&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-week--_-&#34;&gt;My week \ (._.) /&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally managed to finish some long-overdue assignments.
I gave myself a few days off â€” no tasks, just played video games all day.
Sleep was inconsistent, but Iâ€™m trying to pay more attention to it and find some balance.
Overall, last week was really relaxingâ€¦ so relaxing, it actually stressed me out a little?!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;last-week-in-two-words&#34;&gt;Last week in two words!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was a battle with code and a constant race against time.
I was working on a program, trying to use a library â€” turns out, itâ€™s only for x32, and I have a 64-bit system.
Urgent search for an alternative began, with the deadline just 3 days away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical student life: juggling bugs, studying, and trying to get some sleep (plus a bit of gaming to stay sane).
Some days felt like a race against the clock, but what can you do â€” thatâ€™s the reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least coffee exists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened-last-week&#34;&gt;What happened last week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was extremely intense: early morning classes, urgent homework,
and prepping for exams (why are all the deadlines always on the same day?!).
Despite the workload, I still found time for late-night gaming sessions â€” I was studying platformer mechanics after all,
that counts as learning too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Unity, I created a prototype of a 2D game and realized two important things:
first, the entire gameplay depends on the precision of jumps and controls, and second, testing is hard but essential.
Iâ€™m already working on improvements for the next version!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ðŸŽ‰ What happened in the last week?</title>
      <link>https://sayprachanh-lsvnv.github.io:1313/en/post/post1/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened-last-week&#34;&gt;What happened last week?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had so much work that needed to be finished and submitted before the deadlines.
It felt like everything piled up at once â€” assignments, programming tasks, and random urgent matters.
I kept telling myself: &amp;ldquo;Just one more task,&amp;rdquo; but before I knew it, it was already 3 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so focused on getting everything done that I barely slept. Coffee became my best friend,
and sleep â€” my only salvation. Still, I managed to submit everything on time, and it was a relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m trying to get my sleep back on track and maybe even take better care of myself.
Lesson learned: deadlines matter, but so does sleep!&lt;/p&gt;
